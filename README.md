Birthday cake React app I made for my sister's birthday.

User is prompted to enter their age, which triggers an animation of that number of candles dropping down onto the surface of a cake. The user can then blow onto the screen, which is picked up by the computer mic and used to blow out the candles with a randomized frequency. Once all candles are blown out, the text "Happy Birthday!" appears on the screen.
